# Critical Care for Non-Interventionists

This session will provide an overview of critical care for non-interventionists.

## Symptoms of COVID-19 patients

The spectrum of symptomatic COVID-19 infection ranges from mild to critical; most infections are not severe. Specifically, in a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included approximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an estimation of disease severity:

- *Mild* (no or mild pneumonia) was reported in 81 percent.
- *Severe* (e.g. with dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50 percent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48 hours) was reported in 14 percent.
- *Critical* (e.g. with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) was reported in 5 percent.

## Care of patients who are critically ill

The topic addressed in the sessions are:
* COVID-19 Basics
* Recognition and care of patients who are critically ill, hypotensive, in acute respiratory failure, or mechanically ventilated
* COVID-19 unit workflow
